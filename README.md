# Diabetes-Prediction_-Support-Vector-Machine
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting diabetes using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. It covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. SVM is a powerful classification technique known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and creating clear decision boundaries by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes. It is particularly useful for binary classification problems and handles both linear and non-linear data through kernel tricks. The project includes evaluation metrics and visualizations to assess model performance. Required packages are Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
